# Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Kevin, a junior developer 💻 with great passion and taste for programming ⚡, 
I specialize in the field of web development 🌐, however I really like mobile 📱 
development with flutter and react native, I like development with .NET technologies

Anyway, I love ❤ being constantly learning 💡 about the development technologies ⌨
that I like and reinvesting myself from time to time as well as studying and acquiring new knowledge.

🐣 Connect with me in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gkevin_y).
